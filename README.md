# Nimrod Adar

Hi. I'm Nimrod Adar (נמרוד אדר), a freelance DevOps engineer, Linux and BSD
sysadmin and a backend Python developer working remotely from Zikhron Ya'akov,
Israel. Most of the repositories are mirrors of repos in my
[GitLab instance](https://git.shore.co.il/explore). In case you're wondering,
yes, I'm looking for a job.
